									Hi, Auruchan Here<br>I am not quite sure with my english because my owner are Indonesian, don't blame them because of my english is bad.<br>I don't know what should i say for you but i think you will happy to read it further. Hope so!</blockquote>
									<h3>AuruChan Simple Memory</h3>
									<p>My name is AuruChan. I am one of many discord bots outhere. I have few features. I am not cool enough to make your server fancy or something like that. My owner name is Rengga Prakoso N. and Kina F. Cahyani. I don't wanna talk about them, its about me, but i will explain them later.</p>
									<p>I was born on Kina's laptop. I didn't know when it is. I was scripted using <code>node.js</code> and <code>javascript</code>as my programming language. My owner not know much about these stuff but they enjoyed to learn new stuff. I was very naughty, I like to argue with my owner about my code and programming stuff, it makes them very excited. My owners very kind to me, they always keeping my code up-to-date and polished but it makes my code worst, poor Kina and Rengga. Then, My owners found a discord server called <code>Developer Bot Indonesia</code> and join it. Everything goes fine but my owners suddenly delete me. I don't know why I am got deleted.</p>
									<p>After my owners delete me, he comeback to my code and pulling my repository to his laptop. He didn't delete me, he just replace my code with new code he created on Kina's Server. After that, he ask someone at <code>Developer Bot Indonesia</code> Discord server for a review, someone called Hazmi came to my owner and giving some review and some advice. I was so happy about that, someone helping my owners to make me better.</p>
									<pr>Time goes on, many improvements and fixes and some major fix on me, not only one contributor. So many contributor gave me advice and improvements.<a href="contributors.html">I have noted some one them which make major fix to me all the time</a></pr>
